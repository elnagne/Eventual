# Event Planner :tada:

## Motivation

This project is an Event Planning mobile app created to help users find free events in their area. Users can scroll through free events or post their own free events.

We created this project to help users who are bored and looking for something in their area to do. The app will allow them to find an event they are interested in that they can attend.

This app will also allow the hosts of free events to post their events online in order to attract people to attend.

## Installation

We are using MERN to create our event scheduling website.

To get set up:

Clone our git repository to your local machine

Navigate to the file eventual

Navigate to the file client

Run npm install

Run npm start

## Contribution

This project uses git flow to organize project contribution.

We will name branches feature- followed by the title of the feature. For example: feature-signup

We will be using Jira to track team tickets and issues.

When a member of our team finishes a feature they will make a pull request using the branch they created for their feature. Then during a team meeting the team will review the pull request together to ensure that it runs correctly with the rest of the project.
