### Competition

#### Eventbrite (https://www.eventbrite.ca/)

Differences: Our website is only focused on free events, whereas Eventbrite allows both free and paid events. While Eventbrite allows users to filter for free events, the homepage doesn't allow you to turn off paid events, only when searching, making it impossible for a user to get targeted recommendations without having to check each event for the price.

Users: Our website intends to attract users that want to browse every event without worrying about whether it requires a fee to get in. Users that are interested in more personal events, such as local chess games and clothing donations, rather than large conventions and performances that require a ticket.

Eventbrite makes a commission off ticket sales, and it is unlikely that they will pivot and attempt to split their audience by creating an separate site for just free events. Similarly for the homepage, Eventbrite hopes to convert their free users into paying customers by keeping the homepage ambiguous, and requiring clicks to check, creating investment. Their current model is more profitable, making it unlikely that Eventbrite would try to break into our niche.

#### Meetup (https://www.meetup.com/)

Differences: Meetup charges an organizer monthly fee to post events. This is untenable for most grassroots events, and is not included in our website. Similarly, their website does not allow filtering of paid and free events, making it harder to find free events.

Users: We want to attract event organizers that don't intend to make any money from the event. A first time organizer who wants to hold a small chess tournament in a week and doesn't want to pay a subscription and take the risk that nobody joins. A charity that uses this website as one of its many social media feeds that it posts events on, not wanting to juggle a subscription.

Meetup doesn't take a commission, and therefore it needs to charge everyone who organizes an event a subscription price. Since Meetup was built around this business model, altering it would be costly and would require them to focus on monetizing their paid events or severely downsizing to adjust for the decreased cashflow, making competition from their end unlikely.
