## Problem Objectives:

The main project projection is to provide users with the ability to find free events in their city that they can then sign up for. Large events including things like community BBQs and small events like board game nights can be found. Events will be organized to suit user preferences and options like liking events, looking at a history of past events, and rating events will be available.

## Key Users:

Individuals who hope to attend a free event in their area need an app to scroll through and find an event they are interested in.

Individuals who are hosting free events need a place to post and advertise their event details.

## Key Use Cases:

### Search and filter through free events in a user's area:

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On a user's feed, they will be able to scroll through the different types of events in their area. These will be sorted by popularity. However, if a user would like to sort them based on a specific category like sports or concerts. This option will also be available.

### Post free events to attract more attendance.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On an event post, there will be an option to add a title, picture, description, date, and the number of spots available.

### Cap the number of users that can attend a free event.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This ability will ensure that users do not attend overcrowded events by closing sign-up after the number of spots available is filled.

### Store liked events

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The app will allow users to store events as liked events so that they can save an event without signing up for it.

### Store a history of events attended

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The app will allow users to store events they’ve already attended so that they can keep track of their usage.

## Key Usage Scenarios:

Megan finished all her university assignments early on Saturday morning and had nothing to do in the afternoon. She wanted to play soccer so she went on Event Planner to look for a game in her city. After filtering on the app to view sports games on Saturday afternoon she found a group of girls playing at 2:30. She wasn’t sure if she could get her mom to drive her to a field so she liked the event. Then she asked her mom for a ride and her mom said yes. After asking, Megan returned to the app and found the soccer game in her liked events. Then she signed up for the event.

Anna, a computer science teacher at Utsc, wanted to throw an event to help Women in Stem look for mentors. She has used the app Event Planner several times to find free events in her area so she figured it was the perfect place to list her event. She went on the app and created a post to be listed in the Women Only section. This post had a max sign-up space of 400 people because Ashley's lecture hall could only sit that many. She set the date to be Monday, September 25th, 2022 and the location to be Utsc Instructional Center room 104. She added a description and waited to be notified when individuals signed up.
