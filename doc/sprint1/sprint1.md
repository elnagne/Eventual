# Sprint 1 Planning Session
Following the release planning meeting, we held our planning session for Sprint 1 in the team Discord server. The primary goals of the meeting included:

 - Identify high-priority user stories to complete during Sprint 1
 - Break down the high-priority user stories into tasks
 - Estimate the high-priority user stories using poker planning
 - Determine each team member's capacity
 - Determine each team member's experience with the MERN stack
 - Assign at least one story to each team member

Due to the current limitations of the class JIRA (i.e. unable to create epics, stories, subtasks, sprint tracking), we simply created a "Task" for each story for the time being.
All team members were present at the meeting.

# Goal
Finish stories RUN-6, RUN-15, RUN-30, RUN-31, RUN-32, RUN-34, RUN-35, RUN-37. In addition, team members should spend time familiarizing themselves with the MERN stack.

 # Spikes
 
 - Each team member has at least one aspect of MERN that they have not used before and need to learn.
 - Team members are not familiar with system design & planning.
 - JIRA is lacking several features that some team members are familiar with.
 
 # Capacity
