## Sprint Retrospective

Our group accomplished all of our allocated stories for sprint 1, neither taking on too much work, or too little. We were able to build a basic framework that we could build on in future sprints.

However, by not focusing on finishing our user login token in sprint 1, we ended up putting a bottleneck on most of our sprint 2 stories, creating conflict in trying to build our sprint 2 app. Furthermore, due to having fewer stories in the previous sprint, we had to allocate much more to future ones.
