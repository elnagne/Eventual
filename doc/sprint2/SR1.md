# Sprint Retrospective 1

## Participants
- Anabelle Hsiao
- Jeremy La
- Ricky Su
- Mohamad El Kadri
- Nevin Wong
- Ivy Wills

## Analysis

Our group accomplished all of our allocated stories for sprint 1, neither taking on too much work, or too little. We were able to build a basic framework that we could build on in future sprints.

However, by not focusing on finishing our user login token in sprint 1, we ended up putting a bottleneck on most of our sprint 2 stories, creating conflict in trying to build our sprint 2 app. Furthermore, due to having fewer stories in the previous sprint, we had to allocate much more to future ones.

## Good Practices
- Frequent communication between team members
- Team members were very willing to help each other with their tasks

## Bad Practices
- Crammed a lot towards the end of the sprint
- Did not make effective use of the Trello board

## Positive Experiences
- Lots of new learning experiences, especially for technology commonly used in the industry

## Negative Experiences
- Had trouble implementing unfamiliar technologies (e.g. JWT)
