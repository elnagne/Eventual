# Sprint 2 Planning Session
Following the release planning meeting, we held our planning session for Sprint 2 in the team Discord server. The primary goals of the meeting included:

 - Review user stories from Sprint 1 that are unfinished and/or require additional work
 - Identify high-priority user stories to complete during Sprint 2
 - Break down the high-priority user stories into tasks
 - Estimate the high-priority user stories using poker planning
 - Determine each team member's capacity
 - Assign at least one story to each team member

As per the professor's recommendation, the team also moved the product backlog from JIRA to the free version of Trello. Each team member is responsible for porting their own user stories to Trello.
All team members were present at the meeting.

# Goal
Finish stories RUN-1, RUN-4, RUN-27, RUN-29, RUN-31, RUN-32, RUN-33, RUN-39, RUN-40, RUN-41, RUN-42, RUN-43, RUN-44. In addition, team members should continue familiarizing themselves with the MERN stack. Furthermore, team members should begin finish their tasks prior to Friday to allow time to fix any problems that arise while merging feature branches into the develop branch, and the develop branch into the main branch.

 # Spikes

 - Team members have to familiarize themselves with Trello.
 - More careful planning is required when handling merges for the sprint release.
