## Participants
- Anabelle Hsiao
- Jeremy La
- Ricky Su
- Mohamad El Kadri
- Nevin Wong
- Ivy Wills

## Analysis

Our group accomplished all of our allocated stories for sprint 2, though due to understimating tasks, we ended up finding bugs on the last day, forcing us to cram.

Furthermore, our lack of practice for the sprint presentation ended up causing us to take much longer than expected, due to not understanding how our features worked together. Next time , we plan to do a demo presentation beforehand amongst ourselves before we present to the TA.

## Good Practices
- Frequent communication between team members.
- Team members were very willing to help each other with their tasks.
- Relying on well-tested APIs rather than recreating worse versions.

## Bad Practices
- Crammed a lot towards the end of the sprint.
- Did not practice presentation.

## Positive Experiences
- Lots of new learning experiences, especially for technology commonly used in the industry.

## Negative Experiences
- Had many small bugs pop up on the last day after merging.
