## Participants
- Anabelle Hsiao

- Mohamad El Kadri
- Nevin Wong
- Ivy Wills

## Analysis

Our group accomplished all of our allocated stories for sprint 3, and we managed to find the right balance of story points that we were able to comfortably finish by the end without crunch. Our familiarity with the technology allowed us to spend more time on our stories.

However, while we practiced the demo an hour before, we had to rush due to leaving it so close. In future sprint demos, we will practice our presentation a day before, to give us time to suitably prepare.

## Good Practices
- Frequent communication between team members.
- Team members were very willing to help each other with their tasks.
- Sprint meetings were short but informative.
- Did not have to crunch.

## Bad Practices
- Did not practice presentation until an hour before.

## Positive Experiences
- Managed to pass the sprint without any particular problems, allowing group members to focus on implementing their stories without having to worry about merge errors or bugs.

## Negative Experiences
- Had many small bugs pop up on the last day after merging.
