# Sprint 4 Planning Session
Following the release planning meeting, we held our planning session for Sprint 4 in the team Discord server. The primary goals of the meeting included:

 - Review user stories from Sprint 3 that are unfinished and/or require additional work
 - Identify high-priority user stories to complete during Sprint 4
 - Break down the high-priority user stories into tasks
 - Estimate the high-priority user stories using poker planning
 - Determine each team member's capacity
 - Assign at least one story to each team member

All team members were present at the meeting.

# Goal
Finish stories RUN-2, RUN-8, RUN-9, RUN-36, RUN-100, RUN-103, RUN-104. Team members should be actively working on their stories throughout the sprint, and should aim to have their work finished and merged into the develop branch by Thursday evening. This gives the team a 1-day buffer to identify any bugs and issues.
